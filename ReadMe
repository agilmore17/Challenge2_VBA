Working on this file was definitey more difficult than the original excel assignment which felt like it took no time. 

For this assignment, I really found myself not only scouring old notes and classes but also turning to stackoverflow for the first time.

I definitely only used it for inspiration, I read over a lot of the comments that people had left and looked over the code and how they formatted it for similar projects. 

My biggest sticking point was figuring out how to affiliate the ticker with the highest increase, decrease, and volume for the respective stocks. 
Luckily, I asked the class and one of my classmates who went to tutoring walked me through how he managed to do it, then I replicated it in a similar way that actually worked with my code. 

I did heavily use the class example on how to loop through excel sheets for the formatting on that and overall at the end felt like I walked away with a better grasp of how to use VBA than before. 

Because the file is too large to upload, I put the VBA code in a separate readme file to upload!
